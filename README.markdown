`piston_mini-client` is a small wrapper to the httplib2, allowing fast development
of python applications or modules that uses the REST API's produced through django-piston.

This repository is a port to github of the 
[`piston_mini_client`](https://launchpad.net/piston-mini-client) library hosted on launchpad.

I am making some improvements and will possibly comunicate them to developers at launchpad.
I will also try to mirror improvements from their code base.
